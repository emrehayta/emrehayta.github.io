# Hugo and GitHub Pages: My Journey to the Perfect Blogging Platform

## Introduction

When I decided to start a blog, I found Hugo and GitHub Pages to be the ideal solution for my needs. Both tools offer a great combination of flexibility and simplicity, perfect for a tech-oriented blog like mine. In this post, I want to share my experiences and insights on setting up Hugo and GitHub Pages, along with some useful tips that could help you if you're planning to do the same.

## What is Hugo?

Hugo is a powerful and fast Static Site Generator (SSG). It allows you to create websites that are completely static, which makes them fast, secure, and easy to host. With Hugo, you can write content in Markdown and easily customize your site's design using templates and themes.

## Why GitHub Pages?

GitHub Pages is a hosting service from GitHub that lets you publish websites directly from a GitHub repository. It's particularly useful for projects, personal blogs, and documentation. The integration with GitHub makes it easy to manage changes and keep your site up to date.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Setting Up

### 1. Installing Hugo

First, you need to install Hugo on your computer. The installation is straightforward and varies by operating system. Here's a general guide:

- **Windows**: Download the Hugo installation package from the Hugo website and follow the instructions.
- **macOS**: Install Hugo via Homebrew with the command:
  
  ```bash
  brew install hugo
